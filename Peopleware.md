# Managing People

### Why tech projects fails | real team problems
1. sociological challenges(politics is subset) are more impacting than technology skills/know how.
2. hitech is fad(only few are doing breakthroughs, create the devices, systems and tools), we are in human communication business.
3. good human interactions among all participants/team is key to sucess.

### 1. Manage errors/Accept(even encourage) mistakes
1. During design phase, iteration can lead to stuff which needs to be thrown away, overcome fear to not throw away(as company has spent to produce).
2. If mistakes not accepted, people get defensive and will not try out things in future and will kill creativity.

### 2. Manage Productivity/Recognise Value people bring to table
1. catalyst contribution - someone helping people better communicate with each other
2. English theory which lead to industrial revolution (creativity and ingenutity drives value) is to followed instead of Spanish theory
(there is fixed value and it needs to be squeezed from soil and out of people). Spain spun it's wheels trying to exploit the land end people in the New World.
3. Impact of sacrificing quality
   1. As per psychologists, if basic instincts are threated it will lead to strong emotions.
   2. Self esteem is the most common core instincts that is threatened in workplace whenever we set vague or unreasonable deadlines where we are okay
to sacrifice quality. This will build strong disconnects.

### 3. Identify and embrace Uniqueness
1. Realise and embrace uniqueness of personalities - introverted, creative, focussed, detail oriented.

### 4. Understand team dynamics
