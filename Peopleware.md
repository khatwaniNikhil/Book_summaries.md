1. sociological challenges are more impacting than technology skills/know how.
2. truth is only people who brought breakthroughs are doing hi-tech work, we are appliers of their work. we're in the people business.
3. good human interactions among all participants/team is key to sucess.

### Accept(even encourage) mistakes
1. During design phase, iteration can lead to stuff which needs to be thrown away, overcome fear to not throw away(as company has spent to produce).
